# Feature and Unit Test

Status: In progress

Feature test 

Can be done in irb, it tests what steps we need to take to develop a feature and produces an error. 
After the feature has been developed, the error should no longer occur.

Unit testing

It is testing the smallest part of code it could be testing and that can be logically isolated from the code itself.

Follow the structure:

Arrange → Act → Assert

Arrange - get the script set up for what you wanna do; is there anything that needs to be done before you wanna test for it

Act - what is the action that you wanna be evaluating; that its outcome you wanna evaluate

Assert - Evaluate the act; the return value against a matcher
